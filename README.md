üß† Key Features Implemented

Data Modeling & Relationships

Established Star Schema with Fact Table (Sales) linked to Dimension Tables (Products, Customers, Regions, and Dates).
Defined clear 1-to-Many relationships to enable accurate aggregation and filtering.

Data Transformation (Power Query)

Cleaned and standardized data using Power Query Editor.
Applied transformations like removing nulls, splitting columns, changing data types, and merging datasets.
Created custom columns for profit margin and cost analysis.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Created calculated measures for:
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])
Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])
Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])
YoY Sales Growth = ( [Current Year Sales] - [Previous Year Sales] ) / [Previous Year Sales]
Average Discount = AVERAGE(Sales[Discount])

Interactive Visuals & Dashboards

Designed multi-page dashboards covering:
Sales Overview: Total Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Discount KPIs
Customer Analysis: Top & bottom performing customers
Product Insights: Category-wise and subcategory performance
Regional Analysis: Sales by Country, Region, and City
Used slicers for dynamic filtering (Region, Year, Product Category, Segment).
Integrated tooltips and drill-through pages for deeper insights.

Advanced Visuals & Design

Implemented cards, maps, bar charts, line charts, and donut visuals.
Used conditional formatting to highlight profit/loss trends.
Added custom themes and consistent color palettes for professional presentation.
Used Bookmarks & Buttons to enable page navigation and visual switching (e.g., between Sales and Profit views).

Performance Optimization

Reduced report load time using aggregations and optimized DAX queries.
Disabled auto date/time hierarchies for cleaner models.
Removed redundant columns to reduce file size.
